Description: In this task, you will develop a feature to detect a person with long hair as female, even if they are male, and detect a short-haired female as male, even if they are female. The model should work exclusively for individuals aged between 20 and 30. If an image of a person outside this age range (below 20 or above 30) is uploaded, the model should correctly predict their gender regardless of hair length. Guidelines: This task is designed to test your logic-building and problem-solving skills. We encourage you to embrace the challenge and view it as an opportunity to grow. Please create your own machine learning model and ensure it includes a graphical user interface (GUI). While accuracy is important, we will evaluate your work based on the overall performance of your model and the successful functionality of your GUI. Good luck and enjoy the process!
