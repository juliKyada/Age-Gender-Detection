Task-1. Visualize Activation Maps: Description: Visualize activation maps to understand which image regions activate CNN filters for age
    Activation maps (also called feature maps) help us interpret CNN behavior by showing which image regions activate specific filters. 
    For age detection, this often highlights regions like:

- Wrinkles and fine lines
- Eyes and mouth area
- Forehead texturedetection.
  By visualizing these maps, we gain insights into model explainability and filter attention.
